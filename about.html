        <section id = "about">
            <p>Born “Joseph Thomas Fondriest”, Joey Vesco is an American born rapper, writer, artist, and philosopher hailing from Washington D.C. At a young age, his love for art led him to graffiti, and this exploration of the urban art scene simultaneously led to the discovery and exploration of the urban sound. In that, Joey found solace. Hip hop not only became an escape from the buzz of the city but a door to an alternate timeline full of well articulated ideas wrapped in beautiful environments of sound full of fast drums and loose melodies. Realizing that music decorates time in the same way that art decorates space, he switched from filling walls with color to filling minutes with ideas, dictating his understanding of the world around him though refined lyricism and elegant flows. Pidgenholed in rap, he watched the genre bend and grow overtime, with subgenre after subgenre forming inside of the house of hip hop. As these subgenres grew, so did his ability to find his own sound, taking inspiration from different parts of each genre in attempt to express himself in his most authentic form.</p>
